# This is my Second Semester Final Project

ðŸšŒ Online Bus Seat Reservation System

I have developed an Online Bus Seat Reservation System as a full-stack project.
The system allows users to easily book bus seats online, generate an e-ticket, and receive it directly via email. The e-ticket can also be downloaded and saved to the userâ€™s device for convenience.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
	â€¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
	â€¢	Backend: Spring Boot (Java), MySQL, JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
	â€¢	âœ… Search for buses by departure and destination
	â€¢	âœ… View live bus schedules and seat layouts
	â€¢	âœ… Select and reserve preferred seats
	â€¢	âœ… Fill in personal details for booking
	â€¢	âœ… Automatically generate and receive an e-ticket (with QR code) via email
	â€¢	âœ… Save the ticket easily on your device

This system is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, offering a smooth and modern way to book bus seats online.
